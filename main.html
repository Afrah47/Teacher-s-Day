<p> To my lovely Teachers, we are so grateful to have you as our teachers. I wish you a happy teacher's day. Unfortunately, 
    we can't come to school and celebrate it with you but I know soon that day will come when we will be back to school and celebrate 
    every special day with our classmates and you. It's a honour get taught so many thing by you
